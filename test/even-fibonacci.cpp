 * Project Euler Problem 2:

 * Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
 * two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5,
 * 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 *
 * By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
 * four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
